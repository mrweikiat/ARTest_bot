# ARTest_bot
 
### Inspiration
In this unprecedented era of Covid-19, many of us strive to keep our community Covid-Free by regularly taking ART tests. However, the ART self-test kits may be confusing for first-timers, or people who have forgotten how to use the kits.

### What it does
The ARTesterBot guides the user step-by-step in taking the ART self-test kits. It also provides extra information should the user wish to learn more about Covid-19.

### How we built it
Using Telegram API, we generated a token from @BotFather. For the code, it is mostly based on MessageHandler.

### What's next for ARTesterBot
Encourage more people to use the ARTesterBot until Covid-19 blows over. Hopefully that will happen this year!

### Built With
python and telebot APIs
